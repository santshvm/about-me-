# about-me-
Personal Site 

A simple webpage built using HTML that contains some basic information about me, my educational background, my interests/hobbies and my skills. It has got a hyperlink that links to another page that contains my Twitter, LinkedIn and Github URL and a HTML form where the user can fill the form to drop me a message or feedback. 

I am dipping my toes into full-stack web development and I try to build something with the knowledge that I acquire as I proceed with the tutorial. This project is created as a real-world application of the knowledge I acquired about HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
